when play button is clicked the aim trainer.

you play this game by clicking each red square that shows up on you screen.
<!-- while having a loop i was not able to get it to work how i wanted and because of this was not able to get the squares to be used how i wsanted either -->

goal is to see how many squares you can click in one minute. 
<!-- i was not able to have this work with a timer -->

over all i and the person helping me with this projact just couldnt quite get things figured out. 

i couldnt get my loop to work.
i couldnt get my squares to activate when or how i wanted them to.

i tried my best but as of now i dont have a game that will seem to work in any way.
